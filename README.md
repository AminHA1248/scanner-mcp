# scanner-mcp

A **generic MCP server** that exposes a scanning tool to Claude (and any other MCP
client). It works with **network scanners** through the standard **eSCL / AirScan /
Mopria** protocol and with **USB scanners** through the platform driver stack —
**WIA** on Windows and **SANE** on Linux/macOS. No vendor-specific driver code.

When Claude needs to read a paper document, it can call `scan_document`, and the page
image is returned inline so Claude can read it directly (optionally OCR'd to text, or
saved as PDF).

## What it exposes

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_scanners` | Discover every scanner reachable from this machine (network + USB). |
| `scan_document` | Scan a page/stack and return it as inline images, a saved file, and/or OCR text. |

Backends are auto-detected and degrade gracefully — the same server runs on any OS and
lights up whatever scanners it can reach:

- **eSCL** (`_uscan._tcp` mDNS) — driverless network MFPs/scanners. *Cross-platform.*
- **WIA** — USB (and some network) scanners on **Windows**, driven via PowerShell COM.
- **SANE** (`scanimage`) — USB/network scanners on **Linux** and **macOS**.

## Install

```bash
cd scanner-mcp
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:  .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:  source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
# optional OCR support:
pip install -e ".[ocr]"      # also needs the Tesseract binary installed
```

Platform prerequisites:

- **Windows**: nothing extra — WIA and PowerShell ship with Windows. Install the
  scanner's normal Windows driver so it appears in *Devices*.
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install sane-utils` (provides `scanimage`).
- **macOS**: `brew install sane-backends` for USB; network scanners work via eSCL with no extras.
- **Network scanners**: just be on the same LAN/subnet; mDNS handles discovery.

## Connect it to Claude

### Claude Desktop
Edit `claude_desktop_config.json` (Settings → Developer → Edit Config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scanner": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\aminh\\scanner-mcp\\.venv\\Scripts\\scanner-mcp.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

On macOS/Linux use the venv path `/path/to/scanner-mcp/.venv/bin/scanner-mcp`.

### Claude Code (CLI)
```bash
claude mcp add scanner -- /path/to/scanner-mcp/.venv/bin/scanner-mcp
```

Restart the client, then ask Claude: *"List my scanners"* or *"Scan the document on the
glass and read it."*

## Configuration (env vars)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SCANNER_MCP_SAVE_DIR` | `~/Scans` | Where scans are written. |
| `SCANNER_MCP_LOG` | `INFO` | Log level. |

## `scan_document` options

`scanner_id` (from `list_scanners`; auto if only one), `source`
(`auto`/`platen`/`adf`/`adf-duplex`), `resolution` (DPI), `color_mode`
(`color`/`gray`/`lineart`), `output_format` (`png`/`jpeg`/`pdf`), `save_dir`,
`return_image` (inline images for Claude to read), `ocr` (extract text).

## Notes & limitations

- **eSCL** covers most scanners sold in the last ~decade (anything "AirPrint/AirScan"
  or "Mopria" capable). Older USB-only units go through WIA/SANE instead.
- PDF output for multi-page WIA scans is assembled with Pillow.
- HTTPS eSCL devices use self-signed certs, so TLS verification is disabled for them
  (typical for LAN scanners); prefer a trusted network.
- This server performs local hardware I/O only — it does not send anything to the cloud.
